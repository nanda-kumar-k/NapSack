# We’ve just taken the topic publicity management systems but finding a problem statement was an initial task! 

We wanted to proceed only with help of design thinking, so we started to proceed with the methodologies of design thinking and stared to proceed only in the directed procedure of design thinking.

After sessions of discussions and case studies we have come up with many problems out of which we’ve started to get a case study on the problem we found quite interesting, so we then jotted down.

We took one of the first steps of designing a solution that was to ask for the questions to both the buyers and the sellers, we started to ask interviewing many buyers and sellers about the problems they face.

We started off with interviewing some regular online shoppers from our friend circle and with some outsiders as well.
The statement (final, average) we got from the buyers was like “whenever I order any product from online shopping website it usually takes 5-10 days of time to get the product at my doorstep “this was a problem statement for the customer point of view. 

On the contrary our project was a one which was meant to sort out the problem of the smaller business systems and support the small-scale sellers help them with management and publicity of their businesses.

We had to take up another session and case study for the smaller group of sellers and the problem statement from the seller end.
We took interviews of sellers too from various shops which you can find in our LinkedIn page https://www.linkedin.com/company/napsack , So anyways the problem statement which we got was “I want to make a good profitable business online but my management and publicity for the local thing Isn’t that promising, so I need a support”

Now that we got our two parts of the problem statements now was our chance to make a change and do something with the questions, with the statements we had. after many brainstorming sessions we agreed to move our answers to ideation phrase where we made out a long list of solutions that seemed promising.

At this phrase we already completed our 3 phrases of design thinking (emphasize, define and ideate).
We were now with a proper idea of how to proceed in this journey of finding solution our idea was simple it was to help the customer and a seller with a website that could solve their problems, and which could possibly show them the change Infront of them.

We wanted to make a website that would deliver the product to customer withing half an hour to one hour, would have great quality and security delivering to our customers that was something with a heavy promise and next we wanted to make an inventory system to out sellers who could add and manage their data and find ease at managing it.

Now the part was of delivery! that’s the solution to the mystery which would have the most prominent role to our company that was our delivery agents, they help us for delivery and also for the shop verifications.

So, after this whole time of business model decisions and all we started to do the implementations so as we moved forward, we got clarity on how it’s done.

We basically made 4 modules for our website 
1.	Admin dashboard
2.	Customer dashboard
3.	Agent dashboard
4.	Delivery dashboard

we made it more flexible and feasible after using map box, OpenStreetMap, java script geo locations,  to get accurate locations of sellers and customers, the delivery agents are also supported with the directions and exact locations for deliveries and shop verifications.

We also used some of the random functions by adding recommendation page for the customers and each customer gets a unique page of products that changes every time.

# So, what’s the main thing from our NapSack Website?

We yeah this is a question that we asked ourselves at each point of time well the answer to it is simple but specific we support the cause of decentralizing and making the smaller to have a platform for themselves basically we don’t see a big brand of online shopping websites supporting a small-scale seller and we wish and act upon to bring a change in the industry.

The main difference that we bring to the market is that whenever a customer wants to buy a product our website directs the closest stores (closets in the term of nearest market) this helps the user to discover shops near him and get the product delivered in the closest time.

Our thing is simple “what if I am busy today and I want to buy something, but I can’t go out, but still I want to buy that coz its urgent, I can’t do online shopping because it takes so much time! “

We come here solving the statement and bringing visible change.

In the same process we help the small seller to bring and manage his business online just having as many resources and marketing as any other big trader seller on the platform.

His business shall prosper because of the exposure we try to bring on his shop and the attraction to his local customers who didn’t know about his business.
